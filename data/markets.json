The lower bound for this market is $5,000/BTC, and the upper bound is $15,000/BTC - you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short share price corresponds with the BTC price. The market will be settled according to Coingecko’s BTC page at roughly 12pm EST on November 4th, 2020. Long and Short shares will settle proportional to the final value, in the case of the final value being between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Share is capped at $1. Refer to calculator for share price and BTC price correlation. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",

If he says something to the effect of Joe Biden winning \"but...\", but in the context of him still contesting results, saying he should have won and he is taking action to try and still win, this market will resolve to \"No\".
